## 1. Project Overview

Digital GreenWall is a **mobile-first, user-centered app prototype** designed for students aged **12–18** living in urban environments where access to nature is limited. Many students spend long hours on screens and experience stress, reduced focus, and disconnection from the natural environment.

The app uses **short eco-challenges, visual progress, AR-based nature experiences, team activities, and rewards** to help students build small daily habits that reconnect them with nature in a fun and motivating way.

This project was created using the **design thinking process** and focuses on **clarity, usability, ethical AI ideas, and behaviour change**, rather than technical complexity.

---

## 2. Design Thinking Process

The prototype was developed following all required stages of the design thinking cycle.

### 2.1 Empathize & Define

User research was conducted using short surveys and informal interviews with urban students.

**Key findings:**

* Students feel calm around greenery but lack space and time.
* Long screen time increases stress.
* Short, achievable tasks feel motivating.
* Visual rewards and streaks encourage consistency.

**Problem Statement:**
How might we help urban students reconnect with nature through small daily actions using a digital solution that fits naturally into their screen-based lifestyle?

---

### 2.2 Ideate & Sketch

Using “How Might We” questions, multiple feature ideas were explored and refined.

**Key ideas selected:**

* Daily eco-challenges instead of long tasks
* Visual growth to show progress
* AR to bring nature into small spaces
* Team-based motivation
* Simple rewards instead of pressure

Low-fidelity sketches and user flows were created before moving to the final prototype.

---

## 3. Core Features (Scenario-1 Requirements)

The prototype includes **all compulsory features** required by the Scenario-1 rubric.

### 3.1 Daily Eco-Challenges

* Short 5–10 minute tasks (home, school, outdoors)
* Clear instructions and purpose
* Updates streaks, eco points, and progress

**Why it matters:**
Encourages realistic, repeatable eco habits.

---

### 3.2 Nature Experience

* Adding plants in the green walls of the user
* Simple preset scenes to avoid confusion
* Linked to real-world nature awareness

**Why it matters:**
Helps students feel connected to greenery even in small urban spaces.

---

### 3.3 User Progress Dashboard

* Streak counter and completion ring
* Eco-avatar growth (seed → plant)
* Simple and visual, not data-heavy

**Why it matters:**
Shows that small actions lead to visible progress.

---

### 3.4 Missions and Challanges

* Challenges with shared goals
* Focus on learning and improvement
* Reduced competitive pressure

**Why it matters:**
Motivates students through giving a satisfaction of completing a mission rather than stress.

---

### 3.5 Rewards & Badges

* Badges and levels for consistency
* Visual recognition instead of punishment

**Why it matters:**
Supports long-term motivation in a positive way.

---

## 4. Prototype Design & Navigation

The final prototype was built in **Figma** as a **high-fidelity, clickable mobile app**.

### Screens Included

1. Welcome / Onboarding
2. Home Dashboard
3. Daily Challenges
4. GreenWall
5. Rewards
6. Profile

### Navigation

* Bottom navigation bar for smooth movement
* Consistent layout and icons
* Simple language and minimal text

### Animations

* Progress bar fill
* Challenge completion feedback
* Plant growth animation
* Badge unlock animation

Animations are subtle and purposeful to improve engagement without distraction.

---

## 5. AI-Assisted Logic (Simulated)

No real AI model is implemented, but **AI behaviour is conceptually planned**, as required by the assessment.

**Example logic:**

* If user completes challenges regularly → suggest slightly harder tasks
* If streak breaks → suggest easier recovery challenges
* If AR scenes are frequently used → recommend similar calming activities

These ideas demonstrate how AI can **support users ethically**, without control or manipulation.

---

## 6. Testing & Iteration

The prototype was tested with **3 students** from the target age group.

### Feedback Received

* Challenges felt achievable and motivating
* Progress visuals were clear
* Leaderboards felt stressful for some users

### Improvements Made

* Provided more personalization by adding plants in the system
* Removed Leaderboards Section

This iteration improved usability and reduced pressure on users.

---

## 7. Reflection

This project demonstrated how **design thinking and AI concepts** can be used together to solve real-world problems in an ethical and user-focused way.

Key learnings include:

* The importance of empathy in design
* Using AI as guidance, not control
* Designing for motivation without pressure
* Creating meaningful behaviour change through small habits

---

## 8. Conclusion

Digital GreenWall is a complete **user-centered prototype** that meets all Scenario-1 requirements. It demonstrates research, ideation, prototyping, testing, and reflection while keeping the solution simple, ethical, and realistic for students.
